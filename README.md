## Devlog
When creating a level, a scene is a lot like water. If H2O is the molecule that makes up water, then the molecules that makeup a scene are the game objects. And, like how H2O is made up of the atoms hydrogen and oxygen, then the atoms that makeup game objects are components. Like molecular structures, it is how we as game designers arrange the building blocks of our games that determines the final product.
